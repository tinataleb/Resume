## Augmented Practices 
- Participated in an NSF-funded HCI research opportunity at UC Berkeley’s hybrid ecologies lab.
- Designed an instructional interface to improve user experience.
- Protocoled and conducted multiple user studies using techniques such as Wizard-of-oZ to rapidly produce and modify prototypes.
- Used Max/MSP to remap a launchpad and to develop high-fidelity prototypes that provide real-time sonic cues based on data received from sensors.
- Collected, analyzed and visualized data using micro-phenomenological interviews and repertory grids.
- Learned how to design and mill PCBs.
- Presented in a techtalk and poster session.

## TiNick
[Watch video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovc0pRsrq_w)

Developed an algorithm to generate random worlds and used it to build TiNick game. This game is written in Java and uses advanced data structures such as maps and uses StdDraw library for the graphics. The game generates a random world using the given seed and generates new worlds using random seeds after the players goes through a door.

## Maze Game
Used Dijkstra's algorithm and advanced data structures for a group project. Developed classes, organized our team, and created UML and sequence diagrams. The game generates a new random maze using a different algorithm than TiNick. I had the role of team leader in addition to being one of the programmers.

## Hangman Game
Used polymorphism and GUIs to create a game for my advanced Java class(less than a year programming experience) and got placed 3rd in MCC’s 10th Annual Coding Competition.

# Work Experience
## Summer Intern at GitHub *(Summer 2019 - Present)*
Designing and implementing solutions to prevent churn and minimize customer dissatisfaction among different groups of users.
## Hybrid Ecologies Lab *(Summer 2018 - Present)*
Worked as an undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley's HCI lab. Started with my REU-funded summer research and has been assisting the researcher in different projects at the lab.
## Math and Computer Science Tutor *(Winter 2015 – Present)*
Tutored, consulted, and mentored students with college-level math and computer science courses at MiraCosta College and UC Berkeley’s Center of Access to Engineering Excellence. My area of focus is algorithms, data structures, coding strategies, and debugging in Java and
python for computer science courses and Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Discrete math.

# Volunteer Experience 
##### Volunteered at multiple events as panelist and speaker to share my ecperience with new and incoming students at UC Berkeley.
##### Helped K-12 students at MiraCosta’s STREAM to program a robot to walk through a maze to illustrate basic concepts of computer.
##### Helped my computer professor to teach middle school girls how to program a robot at “Girl Tech Conference and Expo” and shared my story with them.
##### Assisted a teacher at Sage Creek High School to help AVID students improve their math skills.
